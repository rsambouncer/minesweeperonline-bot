This is a bot that plays Minesweeper. It is specifically built for minesweeperonline.com

To use it, paste bot.js into the console, start the game (by upcovering a small area), and then press c. The bot will automatically uncover and flag all tiles that it can figure out with 100% certainty. 

The bot will not make any guesses. If it reaches a point where continuing the game reguires guessing, it will stop.
